<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/dksuiQj.gif)

this is my first published github project, trying to solve the first challenge from devchallenges.io

i just just my knolege on css trying to implement the best practices i have been learning recently like css grid and flex also to use the rigth html structure.
### Built With

## Complications

i found a bit confusing when to use grid and when to use flex, considering that its a resposive web design, not to mention that in some resolutions the pictures goes out of the grid.
